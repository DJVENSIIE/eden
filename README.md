### A short presentation
Eden is the 2nd version of the **Legendary Games Studios** game launcher.
It is supposed to launch games, to be a link between the players
and developing teams, and to store players gaming data by
using our API _Nexus_.


### Technologies
We are using Gradle to organize the project itself, and the language used to make Eden
is JavaFX.


### Some links
You can download the latest version of Eden [here](https://lgs-games.com/en/eden). \
The git repository is available [there](https://github.com/lgs-games/eden). \
And finally, we have a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/mc5OKuQH/eden) to stay organized.


### Installation

You may use ``gradle build`` to build the project, then
``gradle run``.
