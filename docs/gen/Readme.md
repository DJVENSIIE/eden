# Generated

Here we should store generated files.

# eden-xxx.jar

Our application as a ``.jar`` file. Can't be run as if, you would
need to add vm options ``--module-path PATH_HERE --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml``
and change ``PATH_HERE`` with
a path to ``libs`` folder at the root of the project.

For me, in IntelliJ, I use
``--module-path libs --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml``.
