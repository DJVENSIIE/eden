We are proud of version 3.1.0 of Prim.
The main idea with this update is to make the game less easy to play,
and more fun since you might lose any time!

Still, a lot to do like improving the graphics or the game
feel on top of adding achievements. Still, we hope that you
will enjoy the game even more.

## Gate

The gate will now randomly generate garbage,
and we are using a portal image now!

The score function also got changed to make it
quite harder to score a lot.

## Costs

Collector upgrade price got increased since most people only
bought one collector. Now it might give some people the thought
of buying more collectors.

The sources now produce more resources, and the goal
is now **5000** (was 10000). The reason is that after building
all of our production chains, then you should be around 4000,
so it won't take long finishing.

You are now starting with 500 E and 500 DD and with 10
FISE and 10 FISA.

The recycling centers got nerfed, they will once produce one
resource (per 10 garbage) per turn.

## Interface

We added a menu with the list of machines, so you can get
information about a machine before buying it.

We are updating in real-time the machine price in-game
if you have some bonuses. We are planning to do the same
for the staff.

## Functionalities

Using your left-click, you can hire FISE/FISA or skip a lot of
turns in one go.

You can see the shortcuts in settings (but you can't change them).

## Other

We finished translating the game, it's now
available in English and French.

The background won't change each time you skip a turn.
