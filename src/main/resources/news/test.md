Legendary Games Studio is honoured to present our new application : Tyrn.

The software is open-source (meaning you can read/edit the source code)
and allow you to create and manage a set of data.

For instance, in an RPG, you can manage all your data related to SKILLS, PLAYERS AND MONSTERS, OBJECTS, QUEST etc... et
easily edit any data.

Take note that the library don't include any assets and only process you already created content in a single file,
sorted in categories. You can find some royalties free assets at itch.io, we recommends
[pvgames.itch.io](https://pvgames.itch.io).
